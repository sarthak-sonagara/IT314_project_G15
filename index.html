        <p>The 15th meeting of Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation 2023 will be held at Goa University, Panjim,
            India. Started in 2008 with the aim of building a South Asian counterpart for TREC, CLEF and NTCIR, FIRE has
            since evolved continuously to meet the new challenges in multilingual information access. It has expanded to
            include new domains like legal information access, social media analysis, mixed script information
            retrieval, information retrival in software engineering and unstructure text based event detection.</p>

            track and evaluation tracks to encourage research in the field of IR and NLP. FIRE also conducts tutorials
            in different domains of IR and NLP. This year to get an exposure to the latest research of IR and NLP in
            industry, FIRE will also host an industry track. Moreover, to promote the exchange of ideas between the PhD
            Scholars and to help boost their research, FIRE will also conduct a Doctoral Consortium.</p>
